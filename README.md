 1) Difference between var, let, and const:

var: Can be re-declared and updated, function-scoped.

let: Can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope, block-scoped.

const: Cannot be updated or re-declared, block-scoped; used for constants.


2) Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter():

forEach(): Loops over array, does something, does not return a new array.

map(): Loops over array, returns a new array with transformed values.

filter(): Loops over array, returns a new array with items that pass a condition.


3) Shorter way to write functions.


4) Extract values from arrays or objects into variables.


5) Template literals use backticks ` instead of quotes.You can easily insert variables and expressions inside ${}.They also allow multi-line strings without \n.
